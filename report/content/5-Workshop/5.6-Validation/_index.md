## Objective

Validate the production system from the user's perspective: the frontend loads through the primary domain, application workflows reach the backend, and Amazon SES delivers application email.

## Confirm system readiness

Our team accessed the system at `https://cloud-ewallet.com`. CloudFront serves the Amazon S3 frontend and routes `/api/*` requests through the Application Load Balancer to the EC2 backend.

Infrastructure health is documented in [Section 5.5](../5.5-Traffic-security/): the target group uses HTTP port `8080`, and the backend EC2 target is **Healthy**. Therefore, this section does not repeat AWS Console evidence or expose an Actuator endpoint solely for screenshots.

After sign-in, the wallet page displayed the account information and current balance. This result also confirms that the frontend called an authenticated API and the backend retrieved data from Amazon RDS.

## Validate money transfer

Our team transferred a simulated balance between two test accounts. Before submission, the application looked up the recipient phone number, displayed the matching account name, and accepted the amount and transaction note.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5.20. Recipient, amount, and note entered for a test transaction.</em></p>

After confirmation, the interface displayed **Transfer successfully**, the sender balance decreased from `210 USD` to `110 USD`, and the form was reset. This confirms that the request traveled through CloudFront and the ALB, the backend processed the transaction, and RDS stored the updated balance.

## Validate email through Amazon SES

Our team used the forgot-password workflow to validate application email. The backend created the reset request, sent the message through Amazon SES, and the user received it from an address under `cloud-ewallet.com`. The link points to the password-reset page on the production domain.

## Result

The validation confirmed three primary production flows:

- The user accesses the HTTPS frontend and signs in to view wallet information.
- Money transfer reaches the backend and updates database records.
- The backend sends application email through Amazon SES.

Together with the **Healthy** target shown in Section 5.5, these results confirm the deployed CloudFront → ALB → EC2 → RDS path and the Amazon SES integration.
